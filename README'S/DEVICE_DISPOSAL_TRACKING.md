# Device Disposal Tracking Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds tracking for device disposal, recording which IT user disposed of the device and when, instead of permanently deleting the device record.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File:** `databases/add_disposed_tracking.sql`
- Added `disposed_by` column (INT, foreign key to users table)
- Added `disposed_at` column (TIMESTAMP)
- Created indexes for faster queries on disposed devices

### 2. Automatic Schema Management
**File:** `includes/functions.php` - Updated `ensureDeviceSchema()` function
- Automatically adds `disposed_by` and `disposed_at` columns if they don't exist
- Ensures backward compatibility with existing installations

### 3. Delete Device Logic
**File:** `delete_device.php` - Complete rewrite
**Old Behavior:** Hard deleted device records and related data (assignments, inspections, repairs)
**New Behavior:**
- Marks device status as `'disposed'` instead of hard deleting
- Records the IT user who disposed the device (`disposed_by` = current user ID)
- Records the disposal timestamp (`disposed_at`)
- Logs audit entry with disposal action and user information
- Preserves all device history for accountability

### 4. Retired/Disposed Devices Page
**File:** `retired.php` - Enhanced display
- Now shows who disposed each device (full name and email)
- Shows the disposal date/time
- Added columns to PDF export: "Disposed By" and "Disposed Date"
- Updated table header to include 8 columns (was 7)

### 5. Device Details Page
**File:** `view_device.php` - Added disposal information display
- Now queries `disposed_by` and `disposed_at` fields
- Displays "Disposed By" and "Disposal Date" fields when a device has status = 'disposed'
- Shows the IT staff member who disposed the device along with their email

## How It Works

### When a Device is Deleted:
1. IT staff member clicks delete on a device
2. Instead of hard deletion, the device record is updated with:
   - `status = 'disposed'`
   - `disposed_by = [current IT user's ID]`
   - `disposed_at = [current timestamp]`
3. Audit log records the action with user details
4. Device appears in "Retired / Disposed Devices" list (not in regular devices list)
5. Full device history is preserved for reference

### Where Disposed Devices Appear:
- **Retired.php**: Full list of all disposed devices with IT staff information
- **View Device.php**: When viewing a disposed device, shows who disposed it and when
- **Devices.php**: Not shown in regular device list (filtered by status)

### Audit Trail:
- Action: "Dispose"
- Records: Device asset tag and IT staff member details
- Stored in: `audit_logs` table
- Traceable by: Date, time, and user

## Migration Steps

### For Existing Installations:
1. Run the SQL migration: `databases/add_disposed_tracking.sql`
2. OR: Simply use the application - schema columns will be auto-created on first use
3. No data loss - existing devices are preserved
4. Previously deleted devices cannot be recovered

## Benefits

1. **Accountability**: Track which IT person disposed of each device
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of who did what and when
3. **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for asset management
4. **Data Preservation**: Device records remain for historical reference
5. **Reporting**: Generate disposal reports with user attribution

## Database Fields

### devices table changes:
| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `disposed_by` | INT (FK) | User ID of IT staff who disposed the device |
| `disposed_at` | TIMESTAMP | When the device was disposed |

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Delete a device as IT staff
- [ ] Verify device appears in Retired/Disposed list
- [ ] Verify "Disposed By" shows current user name and email
- [ ] Verify "Disposal Date" shows current date/time
- [ ] Check device doesn't appear in regular devices list
- [ ] View device details and verify disposal info displays
- [ ] Export PDF from Retired/Disposed page and verify columns
- [ ] Check audit logs for "Dispose" action

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing disposed devices (if any) appear with status='disposed' but no disposed_by info
- ✅ All assignment, inspection, and repair records are preserved
- ✅ Old audit logs remain unchanged
- ✅ No database migration required for adoption (schema auto-migrates)
