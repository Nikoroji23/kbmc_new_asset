## Performance Impact

### Before Cleanup
- Root directory: 50+ files (cluttered)
- Tools folder: 10+ debug files
- Documentation scattered across multiple locations
- Difficult to identify which files are production vs. temporary

### After Cleanup
- Root directory: 40+ production files (clean)
- Tools folder: 1 production utility (focused)
- Documentation: 14 files in centralized location (organized)
- Clear distinction between production and documentation
- **Result**: Faster navigation, easier maintenance, cleaner codebase

---

## Maintenance Recommendations

### Going Forward

**Do Not Create:**
- ❌ test_*.php files in root directory
- ❌ debug_*.php files in production folders
- ❌ Temporary *.md files in root

**Do Create:**
- ✅ Test files in /tools/ folder (with clear naming)
- ✅ Production utilities in /tools/ folder
- ✅ Documentation in /README'S/ folder
- ✅ Updates to CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md for future changes

**Quarterly Tasks:**
- [x] Review and delete test files (Task: Quarterly)
- [x] Update documentation as features change
- [x] Archive old logs
- [x] Review tool usage statistics
