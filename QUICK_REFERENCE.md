          ↓
Security Admin Verifies Master Key
          ↓
Security Admin Approves Request
          ↓
User Created & Activated
```

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Check if Security Admin is set:
```sql
SELECT full_name, is_security_admin FROM users WHERE role = 'admin';
```

### Check pending approvals:
```sql
SELECT full_name, requested_role, reason, created_at FROM user_approval_requests WHERE status = 'pending';
```

### View approval history:
```sql
SELECT u1.full_name as requested_by, uar.full_name as new_user, uar.requested_role, uar.status, u2.full_name as approved_by, uar.approved_at FROM user_approval_requests uar LEFT JOIN users u1 ON uar.requested_by = u1.id LEFT JOIN users u2 ON uar.approved_by = u2.id;
```

### Check master key audit:
```sql
SELECT u.full_name, ska.action, ska.success, ska.created_at FROM security_key_logs ska JOIN users u ON ska.user_id = u.id ORDER BY ska.created_at DESC;
```

## ⚡ Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Invalid master key" error | Verify key was entered exactly. Check DB: `SELECT master_key_hash FROM users WHERE id=X;` should NOT be NULL |
| Approval button not showing | Verify `is_security_admin=1` in DB for your admin account |
| IT Dashboard not accessible | Verify user role is 'it_staff' in DB. Clear browser cache. Try direct URL `/it_dashboard.php` |
| Request not created | Check `user_approval_requests` table in DB. Verify role is 'it_staff' or 'admin' |
| New user not appearing after approval | Check `users` table. Verify status='active'. Check `user_approval_requests` status='approved' |

3. ✅ Generate master key
4. ✅ Test the workflow (see Test Scenario above)
5. ✅ Train admin team on approval process
6. ✅ Backup master key securely
