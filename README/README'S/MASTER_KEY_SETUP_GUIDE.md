---

## 🚀 SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Database Setup

Run the SQL script to add new tables:

```sql
-- In phpMyAdmin, go to your kbmc_asset_db database
-- Copy and paste the contents of: database_security_updates.sql
-- This creates:
-- - user_approval_requests table
-- - master_key_audit table
-- - security_key_logs table
```

**Quick Check**: After running SQL, verify tables exist:
```sql
SHOW TABLES LIKE '%approval%';
SHOW TABLES LIKE '%key_audit%';
```

### Step 2: Designate Security Admin

Only ONE admin should be the Security Admin. To set this up:

```sql
-- Find your main admin user ID (usually 1)
SELECT id, full_name, email, role FROM users WHERE role = 'admin' LIMIT 1;

-- Mark as security admin (replace 1 with actual ID)
UPDATE users SET is_security_admin = 1 WHERE id = 1 AND role = 'admin';

-- Verify
SELECT id, full_name, is_security_admin FROM users WHERE role = 'admin';
```

### Step 3: Generate Master Key

The Security Admin needs to generate their master key:

1. Log in as the designated Security Admin
2. Go to: **Admin Dashboard** → **Security Control**
3. Click: **Verify Master Key** button
4. Since no key exists yet, you'll set up a new one (in production, use `security_setup.php`)

**For now**, generate a master key manually and set it:

```php
<?php
require 'includes/functions.php';
// Generate a secure master key
$masterKey = generateMasterKey(); // 32 characters
echo "Master Key: " . $masterKey;
echo "\nSave this securely! It cannot be recovered.";
?>
```

Or use the SQL approach to set a test key:
```php
// In a test PHP file:
$masterKey = 'test_master_key_1234567890abcdef';
$hashedKey = password_hash($masterKey, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);
$pdo->prepare("UPDATE users SET master_key_hash = ? WHERE id = 1")->execute([$hashedKey]);
```

## 🔑 MASTER KEY MANAGEMENT

### Generating a New Master Key

For production:
```php
<?php
require 'includes/functions.php';

// Generate secure 32-character master key
$masterKey = generateMasterKey();

// Store ONLY the hash in database
$hash = password_hash($masterKey, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);

// Display to admin ONCE
echo "New Master Key: " . $masterKey;
echo "\nImmediately save this in a secure location (password manager, encrypted file)";
echo "\nThis key cannot be recovered if lost!";
?>
```

### Master Key Security Rules

1. **Never share** your master key
2. **Never commit** master key to version control
3. **Only the Security Admin** should have the key
4. **Backup the key** in a secure location
5. **Change the key** if compromised
6. **Log all usage** - check security_key_logs table
7. **Session timeout**: 30 minutes of inactivity

### Viewing Master Key Audit

To see who approved what and when:

```sql
-- View master key usage
SELECT u.full_name, ska.action, ska.success, ska.attempt_ip, ska.created_at 
FROM security_key_logs ska 
JOIN users u ON ska.user_id = u.id 
ORDER BY ska.created_at DESC;

-- View user approvals
SELECT u1.full_name as requested_by, uar.full_name as new_user, uar.requested_role, uar.status, u2.full_name as approved_by, uar.approved_at
FROM user_approval_requests uar
LEFT JOIN users u1 ON uar.requested_by = u1.id
LEFT JOIN users u2 ON uar.approved_by = u2.id
ORDER BY uar.created_at DESC;
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Access Control
- ✅ Only Admins can access: `/users.php`
- ✅ Only IT Staff+ can access: `/devices.php`, `/repairs.php`, etc.
- ✅ Only Security Admin can access: `/security_control.php`
- ✅ Employees can only request devices, view own assignments

### Master Key Security
- Generate in development: `generateMasterKey()` function
- Store hashed version in database only
- Never log the actual key
- Verify before sensitive operations

### Approval Process
- Approval requests are **permanent records**
- Cannot be deleted, only approved/rejected
- Rejection reason is optional but recommended
- All actions are audit logged

### Dashboard Access
- Automatic redirect based on role
- IT Staff → `it_dashboard.php`
- Admin → `admin_dashboard.php`
- Employee → `dashboard.php`
- Role verified on each login

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Invalid master key" error

**Solution**: Verify the key was entered correctly
```sql
-- Check if key exists for user
SELECT is_security_admin, master_key_hash FROM users WHERE id = YOUR_ADMIN_ID;
-- If master_key_hash is NULL, key hasn't been set
```

### Issue: Approval button doesn't appear

**Ensure**: User is designated as Security Admin
```sql
UPDATE users SET is_security_admin = 1 WHERE id = YOUR_ADMIN_ID;
```

### Issue: IT Dashboard doesn't appear

**Check**:
1. User role is 'it_staff' in database
2. User logged in fresh (clear cookies/cache)
3. Navigate directly: `/it_dashboard.php`

### Issue: Pending approvals not showing

**Verify**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_approval_requests WHERE status = 'pending';
```
