# Bulk IT User Creation - Notifications & Audit Logging

## Summary of Changes (June 2, 2026)

**Goal:** When MULTIPLE IT users are created, the system should:
1. ✅ Notify ALL IT staff (not just Security IT Approvers)
2. ✅ Handle bulk notification creation efficiently
3. ✅ Send bulk emails without server overload
4. ✅ Log activities efficiently (one entry per batch, not per recipient)
5. ✅ Persist notifications properly

---

## What Changed

### 1. Notification Recipients Expanded
**Before:** Only Security IT Approvers (`is_security_admin = 1`) received notifications
**After:** ALL active IT staff receive notifications about new IT user creation

```php
// OLD (Line 54)
WHERE is_security_admin = 1 AND status = 'active' AND role = 'it_staff'

// NEW (Line 54)
WHERE status = 'active' AND role = 'it_staff'
```

**Impact:**
- Gracie Ortuzar: ✅ Now receives IT user creation notifications
- Angelo Mendoza: ✅ Now receives IT user creation notifications  
- All other IT staff: ✅ Now receive notifications
- Only Security IT Approvers can APPROVE (no change)
- But ALL IT staff see them for transparency

### 2. Bulk Notification Creation Optimized

**Optimization:** Use `INSERT IGNORE` instead of checking for duplicates first

```php
// OPTIMIZED (Line 71-73)
$notificationStmt = $pdo->prepare("
    INSERT IGNORE INTO notifications (user_id, type, related_id, title, message, is_read, created_at) 
    VALUES (?, 'it_user_created', ?, ?, ?, 0, NOW())
");
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single database call per recipient (no existence check)
- ✅ Faster for 5+ recipients
- ✅ Automatically skips duplicates
- ✅ Reduces database load

### 3. Audit Logging - Single Entry Per Batch

**Before:** Created audit log PER recipient (many spam entries)
**After:** Single audit log for entire batch

```php
// NEW (Line 101-107)
$auditMessage = "New IT user created: {$newUser['full_name']} ({$newUser['email']}) - Role: {$newUser['role']}. Notifications sent to " . count($recipients) . " IT staff members.";

if ($sentCount > 0 || $createdNotifications > 0) {
    logAudit(
        $_SESSION['user_id'],
        'Create IT User - Notifications',
        'users',
        $userId,
        null,
        $auditMessage . " - Emails sent: $sentCount, Notifications: $createdNotifications, Failed: $failedCount"
    );
}
```

**Example Audit Entry:**
```
Action: Create IT User - Notifications
User ID: 1 (Admin)
Record: users/123 (New IT user)
Details: New IT user created: Test User (test@kbmc.com) - Role: it_staff. Notifications sent to 10 IT staff members. - Emails sent: 9, Notifications: 10, Failed: 1
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Audit table NOT cluttered with per-recipient entries
- ✅ Still tracks all details (email count, notification count, failures)
- ✅ Easy to review in audit logs
- ✅ Stays under database size limits for large operations

### 4. Email Sending - Rate Limiting for Bulk

**Before:** Send all emails immediately (can overload server)
**After:** Add delay between emails if many recipients

```php
// NEW (Line 130-134)
if (sendEmail($recipient['email'], $subject, $body)) {
    $emailsSent++;
    // Small delay between emails if many recipients to prevent server overload
    if (count($recipients) > 10) {
        usleep(50000); // 0.05 second delay for bulk sends
    }
}
```

**Details:**
- If recipients ≤ 10: No delay (fast)
- If recipients > 10: 0.05 second delay between each email
- If recipients = 50: Total time ≈ 2.5 seconds (manageable)
- Prevents mail server timeout/overload

### 5. Error Handling for Bulk Operations

```php
// NEW - Track all types of failures
$failedCount = 0;  // Failed to create notification
$emailsSent = 0;   // Successful email sends

foreach ($recipients as $recipient) {
    try {
        $notificationStmt->execute([...]);
        $createdCount++;
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        error_log("[IT_USER_NOTIF] Failed for user {$recipient['id']}: " . $e->getMessage());
        $failedCount++;  // Track failure
    }
}
```

**Response includes:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "sent_count": 8,          // Emails actually sent
    "failed_count": 2,        // Emails that failed
    "notifications_created": 10,  // System notifications created
    "recipients_notified": 10     // Total recipients
}
```

## Handling Many IT User Creations

### Scenario: Admin creates 5 IT users in quick succession

#### Operation Flow:

1. **Admin creates User 1**
   - ✅ api_send_it_user_creation_notification.php called
   - ✅ 10 notifications created (for all IT staff)
   - ✅ 10 emails sent (rate limited if >10 recipients)
   - ✅ Single audit log entry created

2. **Admin creates User 2**
   - ✅ api_send_it_user_creation_notification.php called
   - ✅ 10 notifications created
   - ✅ 10 emails sent
   - ✅ Single audit log entry created
   - **Total so far:** 20 notifications, 20 emails, 2 audit entries ✓

3. **Admin creates User 3-5** (repeats same pattern)
   - **Total after all 5:** 50 notifications, 50 emails, 5 audit entries

#### Database Impact:
- **notifications table:** +50 rows (acceptable)
- **audit_logs table:** +5 rows (minimal, vs 50 if per-recipient)
- **Email queue:** 50 emails sent gradually (not all at once)

#### Performance:
- **Notifications:** ~50-100ms total (bulk INSERT IGNORE)
- **Emails:** ~2.5 seconds (rate limited per email)
- **Audit logs:** ~10ms (single insert)
- **Total time:** ~3 seconds (not blocking)

## Bulk Operation Safeguards

### 1. Error Recovery
- If notification creation fails for 1 user, continues for others
- If email fails, logs error but continues
- Response shows exactly how many succeeded/failed

### 2. Duplicate Prevention
- `INSERT IGNORE` prevents duplicate notifications
- Multiple runs of same API won't create duplicates
- Safe to retry if network fails

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Prevents email server overwhelm
- Gradual email sends (0.05s delay when 10+ recipients)
- Respects email service limits

### 4. Audit Trail
- Single log entry per IT user creation
- Tracks totals: emails sent, notifications, failures
- Shows exactly what happened

## API Responses for Bulk Operations

### Creating 1 IT User (with 15 IT staff members):
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Notifications created for 15 IT staff member(s)",
    "sent_count": 14,                    // Emails successfully sent
    "failed_count": 1,                   // Email failures
    "notifications_created": 15,          // Notifications created in system
    "recipients_notified": 15,           // Total recipients
    "user_id": 123,
    "user_role": "it_staff"
}
```

### Granting Security IT Access (after bulk user creation):
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Notifications synced for 15 recipients",
    "synced_count": 15,
    "created_count": 15,
    "total_recipients": 15,
    "user_role": "it_staff"
}
```

## Database Optimization

### Notifications Table
```sql
-- Original query (before optimization)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications 
WHERE user_id = ? AND type = 'it_user_created' AND related_id = ?  -- Per recipient check
-- Result: Slow for bulk operations

-- Optimized (after)
INSERT IGNORE INTO notifications ...  -- Single insert, skips duplicates auto
-- Result: Fast, no duplicate checking needed
```

### Audit Logs Table
```sql
-- Single entry tracks everything
INSERT INTO audit_logs (
    user_id,
    action,
    table_name,
    record_id,
    notes
) VALUES (
    1,
    'Create IT User - Notifications',
    'users',
    123,
    'Notifications: 15, Emails: 14, Failed: 1'
)
-- One row instead of 15 rows per creation!
```

## Testing Bulk Operations

### Test 1: Create Multiple IT Users
```bash
# Step 1: Create 3 IT users via users.php
# Step 2: Check notifications panel
# Expected: All IT staff see 3 x N notifications (N = IT staff count)
```

### Test 2: Check Audit Logs
```bash
# Go to asset_tag_audit.php or check audit logs directly
# Expected: 3 audit entries (one per IT user creation)
# NOT 3 x 15 = 45 entries
```

### Test 3: Check Emails
```bash
# Check mail logs or email server
# Expected: 3 x 15 = 45 emails sent gradually (not all at once)
# With rate limiting visible in send delays
```

### Test 4: Grant Security IT Access
```bash
# After bulk creation, grant security to one of the new users
# Step 1: Go to Assign Security IT
# Step 2: Click "Grant" for new user
# Step 3: Check notifications + emails
# Expected: Security granted notifications for all IT staff
```
