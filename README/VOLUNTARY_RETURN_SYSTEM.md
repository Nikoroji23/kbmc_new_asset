## 🚀 Testing the System

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Log in as an Employee**
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost/kbmc_new_asset/user_asset_dashboard.php`
   - You should see assigned devices

2. **Test Voluntary Return**
   - Click red return button on any device
   - Modal should open with device pre-filled
   - Enter optional return reason
   - Click "Request Return"

3. **Verify Notifications**
   - Check IT staff email inbox
   - Should receive email within seconds
   - Check notifications.php in system

4. **Verify Audit Logs**

   - Should have VOLUNTARY_RETURN and DEVICE_RETURN_INITIATED entries

### Email Testing

If email is configured via PHPMailer:
- Emails automatically sent to all active IT staff (role = 'admin' or 'it_staff')
- Email includes device/employee context
- Includes direct link to IT Clearance page

If email is NOT configured:
- System notifications still created
- No emails sent (graceful degradation)
- System message indicates email not configured
