```

**Step 2: Set Master Key** (Admin does this)
```

Generate key in PowerShell:
  C:\xampp\php\php.exe -r "echo bin2hex(random_bytes(16)).PHP_EOL;"
  
Fill:
  - Select User: Alfonso Aninias
  - Master Key: [Paste 32-char key from above]
Click: "Set Master Key & Grant Security IT"
✓ Master key set + Security IT privileges granted

DELETE: set_master_key.php file
  rm set_master_key.php
⚠️ Critical step - don't skip!
```

**Step 3: Verify Setup** (Admin checks)

## 🔄 How It Works

### When Admin Creates New IT/Admin User:
1. Admin goes to Users.php → "Add User"
2. Selects Role: **IT Staff** or **Admin**
3. Fills details and clicks "Add User"
4. **Instead of creating the user:**
   - Request stored in database (pending status)
   - All Security IT approvers notified
   - Admin sees: "User creation request submitted for approval"

### When Approver (Alfonso) Reviews:
1. Login as alfonsoaninias0527@gmail.com
2. Go to Security Control Center (security_control.php)
3. Click "Verify Master Key" → Enter 32-char key
4. Review pending requests → Click "Approve" or "Reject"
5. User created or request rejected
6. Both parties notified

### Complete Audit Trail:
- Who requested (admin name)
- Who approved (approver name)  
- When it was approved
- What user details (email, role, etc.)
- All logged for compliance

## ✋ Important Safety Notes

### MUST DO:
1. ✅ Delete `set_master_key.php` after use
   - This file is a security risk if left on server
   - Only needed once to set the key

2. ✅ Store master key securely
   - Use password manager (1Password, LastPass, etc.)
   - Never commit to version control
   - Never send via email/chat

3. ✅ Review master key quarterly
   - Regenerate every 90 days
   - Old key becomes invalid
   - Use same process: run set_master_key.php

### DO NOT:
- ❌ Share master key with anyone
- ❌ Leave set_master_key.php on server
- ❌ Use weak passwords for approver account
- ❌ Skip master key verification when approving
- ❌ Approve without reviewing request details
